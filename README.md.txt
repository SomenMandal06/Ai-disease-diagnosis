# 🧬 AI-Based Diabetes Diagnosis

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical inputs like glucose level, BMI, and age. The model is served through an interactive **Streamlit web app**.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time predictions using a trained ML model
- Clean, user-friendly web interface (Streamlit)
- Model trained on real-world diabetes dataset
- Easy to extend for other diseases
